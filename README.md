# ChatGPT Navigation Chrome Extension
This Chrome extension simplifies navigation in ChatGPT conversations by allowing users to jump to custom responses without clicking arrows.

## How to Use the Extension
1. Download or clone the repository files into a local folder.
2. Open Chrome, go to the Extensions page (`chrome://extensions/`), and enable **Developer Mode**.
3. Click on **Load unpacked**, then select the folder containing the extension files (make sure the files are unzipped).
The extension is now ready for use.

### Keyboard Shortcuts
For easier navigation, the following shortcuts are available:
- **Shortcut to Activate Extension**: `Ctrl + Shift + L`
  - This shortcut will automatically open the extension in Chrome.

**Note**: The extension currently works only on the [chatgpt.com](https://chatgpt.com) website (as of the testing date: January 25, 2024). 
It operates in scenarios where the conversation contains user input with multiple revisions (e.g., a chat thread).

## Demo
You can find the video of the extension in action in the *demo* directory (v2; latest).
